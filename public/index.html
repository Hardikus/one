    <h1>Hello, ClojureScript!</h1>
    <p>With the release of ClojureScript, developers can now write
      web applications in a single language without making
      compromises. This project provides a starting point for
      ClojureScript development with code reloading, templating, a
      browser-connected REPL, and both development and advanced mode
      views of an application.

  <div class="section panel">
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>Designers can work with HTML, CSS and images without
      having to deal with <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/wiki/Syntax">
        Hiccup</a> or Clojure source code.
      Run <code>./script/run</code> and work on the files in the
      <code>templates</code> directory. Templates and snippets will be
      extracted from these files at compile time.</p>

  <div class="section panel">
    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>Work with the ClojureScript application in development
      mode. Each input JavaScript file is visible for easier
      debugging. Use the browser-connected REPL to interact
      with the running application.</p>

    <h2>Production</h2>
    <p>Advanced compilation will remove dead code, minify what
      is left and emit a single JavaScript file. It is possible to
      do something that will break advanced compilation. This area
      allows one to easily check that the application works with
      advanced compilation.</p>
