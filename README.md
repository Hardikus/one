# ClojureScript One

The [ClojureScript][] landscape has changed over the past two
years. There are now many great tools and libraries available for
building ClojureScript applications. This project is being updated to
show how to pull some of these tools together to create a well
designed and maintainable ClojureScript application.

The purpose of this project is to help new ClojureScript adopters find
good libraries and show them how to use them effectively.

This is not an attempt to endorse specific libraries or steer you away
from others. There may be better alternatives than what is used
here. This project simply shows how to get started with ClojureScript
using designs, tools and technology which have worked well for us in
the past.

Contributions are welcome.
